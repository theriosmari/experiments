Notes: 
    # This script requires that you have the function 'shuf' installed.  If not, you can install it, along with other utlilites, via  
    
         $ brew install coreutils
         
    # I didn't change the tense of the verbs to keep the lists more flexible. also that would have been a lot of work, lol
